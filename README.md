# Tracebit

File integrity monitor using SHA-256 baselines.

School Purpose Only.

## Overview

Tracebit is a focused educational cybersecurity utility built with Python. It is designed for defensive learning, local analysis, and authorized administration tasks. The project keeps the workflow simple, readable, and practical so students can understand how the tool works without digging through unnecessary framework code.

## Features

- Clean project layout with a focused purpose
- Defensive, read-only analysis where applicable
- Input validation with clear user feedback
- Graceful error handling for common mistakes
- Copy-friendly terminal or application output
- MIT licensed for simple educational reuse

## Supported Operations

- Validate user-provided input before processing
- Analyze local files, text, logs, network metadata, or configuration data depending on the project goal
- Print or display structured results in a beginner-readable format
- Avoid destructive actions, credential collection, exploitation, brute forcing, or malware behavior

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or newer
- Standard library only

## Installation

Clone the repository, open the project folder, and install or build with the standard toolchain:

```bash
python --version
```

## Usage

Run the project from the repository root:

```bash
python main.py --help
```

## Example

```text
Start the tool, provide a local file, host, URL, log, or configuration sample when requested, then review the generated report.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand one practical defensive security concept
- Practice safe input handling and readable error messages
- Learn how small security tools are structured
- Compare language-specific approaches to files, text, networking, or system data
- Build habits for authorized and ethical analysis only

## Security Notes

- Use this project only on systems, files, and data you own or have permission to inspect.
- Do not paste real secrets into command-line arguments or screenshots.
- Review output before sharing because paths, hostnames, and sample data may be sensitive.
- Network-focused tools use normal platform behavior and should not be used for scanning targets without permission.

## Development

Run the script with Python 3.12+, keep functions small, and prefer the standard library.

Suggested local checks:

```bash
# Run the project help command first.
# Then test with a small, non-sensitive sample input.
```

## Known Limitations

- Built for education and small local workflows, not enterprise monitoring.
- Results depend on operating system permissions and available platform APIs.
- Some projects intentionally avoid advanced features to keep the code beginner-readable.

## Disclaimer

This project is for defensive learning, school assignments, and authorized administration. It does not include malware, credential theft, brute-force attacks, exploitation, payload delivery, persistence, bypass functionality, or unauthorized access functionality.
